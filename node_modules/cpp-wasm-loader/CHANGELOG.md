# 0.9.0 8/30/2018
- Added types to `struct` property.
- Added `mark` option to set a particular section of memory as used.
- Loaders use `mark` option to prevent memory class from using global variables set by the emscripten environment.
- Accepted PR [#11](https://github.com/ClickSimply/cpp-wasm-loader/pull/11) to allow webworker support.
- A few minor improvements made to the loader scripts.

# 0.8.0 8/16/2018
- Readme updates.
- Now supports emscripten complete environments.  They take up WAY more space but provide complete feature support.  The feature is enabled with the new config option `fullEnv`.
- Changed config options to make more sense: 
1. `noWasm` is now `wasm` and works the opposite of before.
2. `loadAsmjs` is now `asmjs` and works just as before.
3. `disableMemoryClass` is now `memoryClass` and works the opposite of before.

# 0.7.9 - 8/12/2018
- Fixed an issue with loader options.

# 0.7.8 - 8/12/2018
- Added `raw` property to promise result, contains the complete returned value from the webassembly initialization.
- Added `asm.js` support.  You can now optionally include asm.js code in the bundle that will be loaded in the place of webassembly if webassembly isn't available.  Allows native code to work back to IE10.
- Added a `noWasm` option to omit Webassembly from builds entirely.
- Changed `externalWasm` option to `fetchFiles`, works on both `asmjs` and `wasm` code now.
